# Why There is need of Spam Filter:

# Business Problem:

When you have a business, getting rid of spam is all the more important due to the fact that these can eat up a lot of your inbox space, as well as a lot of your time when you start clearing these out. These emails can also carry malware and viruses that can compromise company security and data. What can you do to stop these from inundating your work email, and by extension, to stop these from compromising your companyâ€™s security? You can use spam filters.

Spam filtering is an important tool that your company should use to help keep these unwanted messages from entering your inboxes, and to keep people from clicking on potentially harmful emails. According to studies, more than half of the emails that you get are actually classified as junk or spam. This fact alone shows you that there is a large potential for security issues due to these messages, not to mention the drop in productivity because of the time people will spend on deleting such emails from their inbox.
